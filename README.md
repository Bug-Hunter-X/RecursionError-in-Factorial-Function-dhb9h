This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: a RecursionError caused by a missing base case in a recursive function. The `factorial.py` file shows a function that correctly calculates factorials for non-negative integers but crashes with a RecursionError when given negative input. The `factorialSolution.py` file shows the corrected version, addressing the issue by handling negative input appropriately.
